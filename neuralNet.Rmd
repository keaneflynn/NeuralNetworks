# Neural Networks

##  What are they
Neural networks are a subset of machine learning that are an almagamation of modern computer science and psychology. The data processing and analysis is based on the same process that your brains neurons undergo to  process information. Your neurons require a certain amount of activation energy in order to fire and send information beyond the neuron and along to the axon and so on, an input requirement known as action potential. 
## Why use them
